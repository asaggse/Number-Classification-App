# Number-Classification-App
 This is a simple web-based application that classifies a given number into one of four categories: "Zero" for any number ending with 0, "Five" for any number ending with 5, "Even" for any even number, and "Odd" for any odd number. The user can input a number into the provided text field, and after clicking the "Show Result" button, the result will be displayed on the screen. The application uses JavaScript for its logic and CSS for styling purposes.
